  "scienceOverview": "The thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple) is a fixed anatomical structure that does not significantly grow or change shape in adults. However, its visual prominence can be dramatically enhanced through three synergistic strategies: (1) reducing submental and anterior cervical fat through an anti-inflammatory, calorie-controlled diet that targets facial and neck bloat via sodium restriction and inflammation reduction; (2) hypertrophying the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles, which frame the thyroid cartilage laterally and create contrast that makes the cartilage appear larger and more angular; and (3) correcting forward head posture (FHP) through targeted postural exercises that extend the cervical spine, pulling the skin taut over the thyroid cartilage and increasing its anterior projection. This protocol combines all three mechanisms over seven days using evidence-based techniques from sports medicine, postural rehabilitation, and nutritional science.",

Black pepper piperine increases curcumin bioavailability by 2000% through inhibition of hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation.

          "scienceWhy": "The low-dose caffeine provides mild sympathetic stimulation that enhances alertness and posture maintenance. Creatine ensures SCM intracellular water is at maximum for full muscle volume. The anti-inflammatory stack maintains the reduced edema state achieved over the week [Source: PMID 12701816].",

          "scienceWhy": "This final light pump session maximally engorges the SCM with blood, creating visible muscle columns flanking the thyroid cartilage. The isometric holds create sustained occlusion that prolongs the pump effect. Jaw clenches define the mandibular angle for complete neck aesthetics [Source: PMID 24164961] [Source: PMID 25611342].",

          "scienceWhy": "The warm compress maintains the exercise-induced vasodilation in the SCM, prolonging the peak visual window. Maximal mewing pressure elevates the hyoid bone to its highest position, tensioning the thyrohyoid membrane and maximizing the angular projection of the thyroid cartilage [Source: PMID 25611342].",

          "scienceWhy": "The convergence of all protocol factors — reduced cervical subcutaneous water (anti-inflammatory diet + sodium depletion + diuresis), enhanced SCM volume (6 days progressive hypertrophy + creatine), corrected posture (deep cervical flexor strengthening + habitual retraining), and elevated hyoid (mewing practice) — creates a window of maximum thyroid cartilage prominence lasting approximately 60–90 minutes post-pump [Source: PMID 24164961] [Source: PMID 29306562] [Source: PMID 25611342].",

The structural changes (SCM hypertrophy, improved posture, habitual mewing) are semi-permanent and will persist.

          "scienceWhy": "To maintain results long-term, continued neck training (3× per week) preserves SCM hypertrophy, habitual mewing maintains hyoid elevation, and daily chin tucks prevent FHP recurrence.
