  "focus": ["Vasodilation", "Subcutaneous Water Loss", "Nitric Oxide Maximization", "Glycogen Loading"],
  "scienceOverview": "The dorsal venous network of the hand consists of superficial veins lying within the subcutaneous tissue above the deep fascia. Vein visibility is primarily determined by three factors: (1) the diameter of the venous lumen, regulated by nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation via the L-arginine–NO–cGMP pathway; (2) the thickness of subcutaneous adipose tissue and water between the vein and the skin surface; and (3) intramuscular glycogen volume, which physically pushes veins closer to the skin when muscles are engorged. This protocol systematically manipulates all three variables over seven days—first priming the NO pathway with dietary nitrate precursors and L-Citrulline supplementation, then strategically reducing subcutaneous water through natural diuresis and sodium tapering, and finally executing a glycogen super-compensation carb load on Day 6 to maximize the 'pump' effect that forces veins to the surface on Peak Day.",

Garlic contains allicin, which activates hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) signaling that synergizes with NO to relax vascular smooth muscle.

          "scienceWhy": "The convergence of all protocol factors — elevated NO bioavailability (6 days of citrulline + nitrate), reduced subcutaneous water (sodium restriction + diuresis + water cut), and maximized muscle volume (glycogen super-compensation + pump training) — creates a window of peak vascularity lasting approximately 60–90 minutes [Source: PMID 20499249] [Source: PMID 15084272] [Source: PMID 17218556].",

          "scienceWhy": "Gradual rehydration prevents rapid fluid shifts that could cause headaches or dizziness. The balanced meal provides carbohydrates to maintain glycogen stores, protein for recovery, and healthy fats. Resume normal sodium intake slowly over the next 24–48 hours [Source: PMID 15084272].",

          "scienceWhy": "Reintroducing sodium gradually with electrolyte balance prevents aldosterone rebound, which could cause rapid water retention and loss of the vascularity achieved. Magnesium and potassium help maintain vascular tone during the transition [Source: PMID 25430610].",

          "scienceWhy": "An optional late-afternoon pump session can reactivate the reactive hyperemia effect if needed for evening events. The glycogen stores should still be elevated, allowing another pump window. However, recovery is now the priority [Source: PMID 17218556].",

These maintain elevated baseline NO levels that keep veins more visible permanently [Source: PMID 22248502] [Source: PMID 17513403].",
